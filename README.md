Full Stack Software Development: Soil Laboratory LIMS
=========================================================

This Django project is a combined online shop and laboratory information management system (LIMS) for an environmental science laboratory, offering a variety of soil testing services.

The key features of the app are:

* Customer can 'Browse' the range of soil testing services offered
* Customer can 'Order' a sample test kit of their choosing (In production the sample collection kit will be posted to to the customer)
* Customer can 'Submit Sample Details' online. GPS tagging the sample using their devices location identification functionalities
* Staff can 'Receive Sample' into the lab for testing
* Staff can 'Upload Results'
* Customer and Staff can 'View Report' of the sample details and results

This project was developed as the final project in a diploma in Full Stack Software Development through The Code Institute.

The running site can be accessed here https://dc-easca-environmental.herokuapp.com/

Testing
-----------------------

__Code Institute Testers__

As this site is designed by both lab staff and customers and the actions possible by each is reliant on the other, I recommend the following. It is best to use two different browsers i.e. Chrome and Firefox so that the tester can be logged in as two users at once.

* Open the site and sign in as a Staff Member using __username:__ nice_assessor __password:__ StaffPass1
* In a seperate browser register a new account using your email address to receive the confirmation emails
* __As customer__ add a number of different sample tests to your cart and continue to purchase the testing services
* Once an order has been placed you will receive a confirmation email
* __As staff__ go to 'Lab Portal' and using the 'Sample Archive' filter function filter for the username you set yourself for your customer persona. If it is the latest sample order it will be at the top of the list by default.
* Copy and paste one of your ordered sample reference numbers into the 'Dispatch Sample' section. You will see in the 'Sample Archive' that the samples status has been updated
* __As customer__ go to 'Your Portal'. You will again see the disaptched sample and the ordered samples in the 'Live Samples' section.
* Copy and paste the dispatched sample reference into the 'Submit Sample Details' section. The 'Submit Sample Details' form will be displayed
* Fill out the sample details form. For the sample location try using the different methods detailed on the form.
* Once submitted you can view the details you have submitted by clicking on the 'Details' button in the 'Live Samples' section. Note the status has been updated to 'Submitted'
* __As staff__ go to 'Lab Portal' copy and paste the submitted sample reference into the 'Receive Sample' section to record that the sample has been received into the lab. Note the status update in the 'Sample Archive' section
* Select your received sample reference from the drop down selector in the 'Upload Results' section and enter result values. Though the results fields do not have limits use the following real worl possible results P=2, K=55, pH=7, LR_pH=10
* __As customer__ you will receive an email informing you that your results are available. Follow the link in the email to 'Your Portal' and you will see the sample in the 'Completed Samples' section
* Click 'View Report' and you will see that the results are displayed color coded relative to thresholds shown.
* __As staff__ you can also view this report by finding the sample in the 'Sample Archive' of 'Lab Portal'. Alternativily you could filter for 'Status' = 'Complete' and view previously tested samples.



__Code Validation__

* __Python__ was validated using http://pep8online.com/.
* __HTML__ was validated using https://validator.w3.org/. Due to the Django template code embedded in the HTML there were a number of errors.
* __CSS__ was validated using https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. No errors were found.
* __Spelling and Grammar__ was validated using Google Docs.
* __JavaScript__ was validated using https://jshint.com/

__Continuous Integration__

Travis CI was used for continuous integration insuring that the host environment and requirements are met through out the development.
As I have included staticfiles/ in .gitignore, 'python manage.py collectstatic' had to be included in the .travis.yml (https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/blob/master/.travis.yml) file before the tests for the test to pass.

__Automated Testing__

As part of the continuous integration testing a number of automated tests were developed. The automated tests can be found at the following links:

https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/blob/master/samples/tests_views.py
https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/blob/master/samples/tests_app.py
https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/blob/master/products/tests.py

Though thorough manual testing was carried out, see below for details,
more automated tests should have been developed through out the development of the different project features to insure all features worked correctly with each added feature.

__Visual Testing__

The dev tool within Firefox Development Edition was used to test that the pages were displaying correctly (alignment, spacing, position etc.) across different screen widths.

Note: 1. When viewing the Home screen on my own phone the background image is not shown. It shows correctly for all screen sizes when viewed through Firefox dev tools,
and on consulting Code Institute on the issue the tutor confirmed that the background was displaying correctly on his iPhone 5/SE. All caches have been cleared on my phone and still the issue persists.

__Console Log Errors__

Though all features functioned correctly there were a number of errors visible in the console log that are worthy of note.
* The following is generated when the Submit Details View is rendered in firefox: 


Request to access cookie or storage on "Google Maps API Key URL" was blocked because it came from a tracker and content blocking is enabled.

and in Edge:


SCRIPT7002: XMLHttpRequest: Network Error 0x80700013, http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/9/F/B9FF9327-7A72-4165-BF91-9B7EEB6C579B/DeviceList.json

* The following is generated when the Lab Report view is rendered in firefox, I imagine due to the API key being set as a template variable:


You have included the Google Maps JavaScript API multiple times on this page. This may cause unexpected errors.

Development
------------------------

This site was developed in consultation with an environmental lab. They were looking to digitalise some of their lab processes, reducing the time lab technicians and field surveyors spent transferring data from paper to online records.
I was given a tour of their lab and run through of their processes. It was apparent that a lot of time could be saved and so money saved,
if sample details could be submitted by the customer directly to a cloud database and that being able to GPS tag the sampe would greatly improve the tracking of a customers land over time.

As the geo tagging of samples seemed important to the process time was spent researching the different options available through Django in achieving this. GeoDjango was first explored but seemed overkill for the features required for this project.
Django-geotagging, django-location-field and django-google-maps were also investigated but in the end django-geoposition was used for its simplicity. I ran into issues running the stable release with django 1.11 and had to use an alternative work around branch, details can be found in the deploy section below.

Django-geoposition allows the user to select and save a location to a model using a google maps widget, however it does not get the users current location. A script was developed (https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/blob/master/static/js/getLocation.js) making use of HTML5 getLocation function that uses the client
side location features available (either GPS or IP location) to set the location of the user. This was important so that samples could be accurately geotagged when taking field samples. As the django-geoposition map marker initial position are set in Settings.py and the widget used display is generated from this,
it was proving difficult to get the current location to recenter and reposition the marker automatically when the location is found. Though not the most user intuitive the 'how to' style help provided with the model entry was a compromise that isn't too complicated. Geopy was used to get the address of the gps location separately to the django-geoposition.

Time was spent developing a logo using https://www.canva.com/ and paint, these can be found here https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/tree/master/mock-ups/Canvas%20developed%20logos.
It was proving difficult to set the logo background to transparent to blend in nicely with the navbar, so in the end a simple brand logo was developed with standard font and a font-awesome leaf icon.

For the development of the samples results tables in the sample report, the following publication was consulted https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/publications/2016/soil-fertility-green.pdf. For the purpose of this project I concentrated on showing the results for only most basic of soil tests, testing Potassium, Phosphorus, pH and Lime Requirement pH.
The thresholds used in the tables were for grassland land use and these should be programmed more appropriately for the other land uses. The tables of note from the teagasc publication can be found here https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/tree/master/mock-ups/Example%20Test%20Result%20Tables.

It sould be noted that Django has been use for other LIMS systems most notibly https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5192047/. Though the MASTR-MS LIMS was not referenced in the development of this projects it gave me confidence that Django is an industry capable framework that can be adapted for the LIMS purposes.

There are a number of operations that are purposefully awkward by design. The 'Dispatch Sample', 'Receive Sample' and 'Submit Sample Details' input box require that the whole sample reference number be entered. Autocomplete for these form entries were considered but thought that if possible reference numbers were shown there would be a greater possibility that
the user would select one of the given possibilities rather than the one in there hand. In production the dispatch and receive entries will be carried out by a USB connected barcode scanner with this site running locally.

__Notes on Code__

* All custom css tags created in the development of this project include '_', this allows me to quickly see what items I have styled and what items already have style attributes.
* A number of the forms generated by django for use in the templates were unpacked for layout purposes i.e. ln14 https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/blob/master/samples/templates/submitdetails.html.
I was unable to apply the 'as_bootstrap' styling to the unpacked form, however by including 'form | as bootstrap' in comments before the form the correct stylings were applied.
If left not commented out the form would be rendered twice. I consulted Code Institute on the issue and found it an oddity for which they could not resolve and so the hacky method used remains.
* Loose CSS coupling was carried out through out the templates with all custom css contained in https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/tree/master/static/css.
However where django generated urls were used for background images the 'background-image' style attribute was included in the the html code. i.e. ln19 https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/blob/master/templates/base.html
* All Javascript code is run from external js files in the static folder https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/tree/master/static/js.
However where django tags were used global javascript variables were declared in the html template for use in the scripts. i.e. ln354 https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/blob/master/samples/templates/viewreport.html
* A base.html was utitilesed for all templates except index.html as its background and general layout was different

Deployment
------------------------

__Requirements__

The system hosting the app must have a number of python packages installed.
A full list can be found at

https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/blob/master/requirements.txt

Take note that a pip freeze will show django-geoposition==0.3.1, this is not a valid release and will fail both travis and heroku builds.
Django-geoposition latest release available to install with pip is 0.3.0., however this version will not work with django-1.11 and so the work around branch must be installed.

The django-1.11 work around branch is referenced in the requirements as 'geoposition.git@4ed91215a36e737c71fbdc023f134bd2cfe445b3#egg=django-geoposition'.
Alternatively the repo can be referenced using the zip folder https://github.com/philippbosch/django-geoposition/archive/django-1.11.zip.

__System Variables__

The following system variables must be set in the host environment.

* STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE, publishable key assigned to you when you register an account with Stripe https://stripe.com/ie
* STRIPE_SECRET, secret key assigned to you when you register an account with Stripe https://stripe.com/ie
* EMAIL_HOST_USER, the email address you will use to send emails to application users.
This can be your personal email address i.e. johndoe@gmail.com. If using gmail you must allow Less Secure App Access in your accounts security settings https://myaccount.google.com/security.
I set up a dummy gmail account, eascatest@gmail.com, so that my personal email was not left vulnerable by downgrading the security.
* EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, your specified email host login password
* SECRET_KEY, generated by django when you start a new app. See setttings.py file
* GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY, assigned when setting up a google maps api account, https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/, insure that both 'Maps' and 'Places' products are available to the key.
* DATABASE_URL, generated when you set up a PostGres database, i.e. when using 'Heroku Postgres' add-on under resources when deploying app on Heroku.

__Deployed vs Development__

__gitignore__

A number files and folders in the local development environment were not deployed with the project. These files and folders were included in a .gitignore file.

As virtual environment wrapper was used for development. The following associated files were omitted from the git repo from the initial git;

* Include/
* Lib/
* Scripts/
* pip-selfcheck.json
* tcl/

As the deployed project uses a Postgres database the locally generated db.sqlite file was also omitted from git repo from the initial git.

Django generates a staticfiles directory when running collectstatic, this contains a copy of all the static files in the project directories. This was also omitted from the git.
As mentioned in the test section, a collectstatic command had to be initiated in the travis.yml file so that continuous testing would pass.
Though there were no security risks with including the staticfiles directory, these files can be generated by the future developers themselves and once removed GitHub correctly shows the project as being primarily Python coded.

All system variables were declared in an env.py file. As many of these variables were passwords this too was from git repo from the initial git.

If env.py file is not found DEBUG is set to False, this insures that while developing on my local machine the application runs in debug mode but once deployed debug mode is deactivated. Ln36 https://github.com/dcasey720/django_soil_lab/blob/master/django_soil_submit/settings.py

Note: The 'mock-ups' folder was included in the git repo throughout,
normally I would remove the mock-ups from the final deployment, but as the Heroku app was deployed by link to the GitHub repo I thought it better to keep them in the repo.
